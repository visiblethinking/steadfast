Open Source Marine Navagation Suite

Steadfast Marine is a toolbox for accessing raw environmental data from marine instruments replacing standard gauge clusters. Output is both to a screen as well as to marine navigation systems such as OpenCPN by using NEMA standards. The design is modular to allow different types of marine instruments which may have different means of measurment as well as simple output so that it can be adapted to fit the users output needs.

Theory: Most gauges are quite simple reed switches, hall sensors, or rheostats. Depth gauges I still need to figure out but I'll get it.
